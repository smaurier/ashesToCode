# AshesToCode

A personal learning lab to master **React** and **NestJS** through practical projects.  
The goal is to build, break, rebuild, and grow / applying every concept I learn along the way.

## 🚀 Tech stack

- **React / Next.js** (Frontend)
- **NestJS** (Backend)
- **Prisma + PostgreSQL** (Database)
- **Zustand** (State management)
- **Tailwind** (Styling)

## 💡 Purpose

This is not a production-ready app, but a playground where I apply and test all concepts from my React and NestJS training.  
Everything is coded from scratch to deepen my understanding of both frameworks.

## ✅ Principles

- One app, one codebase: all concepts integrated into a single evolving project.
- No copy-paste: everything written and adapted by me.
- Clean code, commits, and structure, as if preparing for a real production app.

## 📝 Notes

This repository is for my personal growth.  
Naming, features, and structure are primarily for learning, not for demonstration to recruiters or clients.
